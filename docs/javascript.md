> Note
>
> ChaosKit does not bundle an es5-version; so remember to include ChaosKit along with any [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transformations as needed.

### Components

Components can be referenced like so:

```js
import { Button } from 'chaoskit/src/components';
```

You can also create a [Webpack alias](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias).
