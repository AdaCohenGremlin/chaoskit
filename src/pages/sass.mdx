# Sass

ChaosKit uses both [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (the [Node](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) flavor) and [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) to build styles.

### Rules

While nobody likes 'em, these rules are in-place to ensure the ongoing quality of the codebase:

* We have 4 distinct breakpoints: small `480px` medium `768px` large `960px` and xlarge `1200`. Please do not introduce a new one.
* Never use IDs as styling hooks. Those are for JS and links.
* Optimize for less specificity. Instead of `div.box`, do `.box`
* Avoid nesting. Instead of `.box .button` do `.button`

### Naming conventions

We write our styles in an object oriented CSS methodology called [BEM](https://en.bem.info/); which stands for Block, Element, Modifier. We have adopted Nicolas Gallagher's naming scheme, [SUIT](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md), which is as follows:

* **Blocks**; the top level components, are camel case. For instance, `.offCanvas`
* **Elements**; children of the block elements, are named like so: `.offCanvas-panel`
* **Modifier** classes are then applied to change the default block styles. For instance `.button--primary`

#### Page-specific styles

No-one likes one-offs, but depending on your project; like a marketing site - you may have the need to create styles that are meant to be used on a very specific page. We get around this by prefixing page-specific styles with the page name. If you're on a product page; prefix styles with `.product__`; like `.product__specialBox`. This; just like namespacing JavaScript classes/methods allows us to maintain a consistent class structure. Then, if you notice that you've re-used those same styles elsewhere; you can pull them out into a global file that has names that fit more within a global-scope; like `.specialBox`.

#### Breakpoints

To help us decipher components that are being impacted by a specific breakpoint, we use the `@` symbol attached to our classnames, like so: `.column-6@medium`. This translates to a six-column element that only inherits those styles on the medium breakpoint. We did this to avoid cases where: `.button--large` could be confused for a breakpoint instead of a size modifier.

**Note:** When writing your own breakpoint modifiers, remember to escape the `@` symbol. You can reference these classes without escaping within your HTML.

```scss
.myComponent {
  width: 200px;

  &\@medium {
    width: 400px;
  }
}

// Compiles to
.myComponent {
  width: 200px;
}

.myComponent\@medium {
  width: 400px;
}
```

### Structure

Every imported file within `framework.scss` is constructed via a mixin with the same name. The mixin is then called via a loop of components that can be modified as needed. This allows for a smarter inheritance system, variables scoped to the component file and easier overrides.

### Typical project structure

```scss
//
// Framework core
//

@import 'framework/core';

//
// Project overrides
//

@import 'site/framework/config';
@import 'site/framework/variables';
@import 'site/framework/button';

//
// Framework
//

@import 'framework/framework';

//
// Project
//

@import 'site/global';

```

**Note:** As a personal preference, we like to keep our framework overrides in a `/framework` directory within our projects, with each component in its own file â€” just as the framework does.

### Modify components

You can modify components three different ways:

#### Variables

Each component has a slew of variables that you can easily override in your project to fit your design needs.

```scss
// Overrides default `border-radius` set by the framework
$global-border-radius: 0;
```

#### Hooks

Hooks allow us to inject additional styles alongside components to reduce selectors.

```scss
// Example provided by framework
.box {
  position: relative;
  padding: $global-whitespace-large;
  border: 1px solid $global-border;
  border-radius: $global-border-radius;

  @if (mixin-exists(hook-box)) { @include hook-box(); }
}

// Use of hook in project styles
@mixin hook-box() {
  &--small {
    padding: $global-whitespace-small;
  }
}

// Compiles to
.box {
  position: relative;
  padding: 32px;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 3px;
}

.box--small {
  padding: 8px;
}
```

#### Removing components

While we may be partial, you might not need all the magic our framework provides. In the interest of size, we provide a configurable `$components` array that you can interact with in two ways:

#### List components

This is a great option when you know the components that you want to use in your project.

```scss
$components: ('base', 'button');
```

#### Remove specific components

What if you want all components except just a few? We have a handy function that abstracts away funky file paths or duplication.

```scss
$components-to-remove: ('badge', 'toggle', 'tooltip');

// Run through above array of components to remove from list
@each $component in $components-to-remove {
  $components: remove($components, $component);
}
```

#### Adding components

ChaosKit also ships with some optional components that are not bundled by default. If you'd like to add them to your build, you can do so by using this function:

```scss
$components-to-add: ('prism');

// Run through above array of components to add to list
@each $component in $components-to-add {
  $components: append($components, $component);
}
```

Build customizations such as this are done within the `site/framework/config` file as mentioned in the aforementioned structure.
